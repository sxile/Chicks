######### POMODORO CHICKS #########
Pomodoro Chicks is a study-companion app using the Pomodoro technique. 
1. Run chicks.py
2. Press 'Start Game' to start. Once started, you'll see your five chicklets walking around. You've got 25 minutes--study away!
3. Once the study timer is up, press the 'start break' button to begin your five minute break.
4. Make sure not to go too far over your break timer and your chicks will be right and happy!
5. If you fail to stay within your break timer five times, you will run out of chicks and lose.

Enjoy!!
